I am an *Master's student in Computer Science* Student at UT Austin. I work at the [LIVE Lab](https://live.ece.utexas.edu/) as a Research Assistant, advised by [Prof. Alan Bovik](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/alan-bovik). I am interested in Computer Vision and Efficient Representation of Neural Networks. 
Previously, I worked as Software Engineer in *Adobe*, where I worked on Adobe's mobile PDF engine and business critical features : Text-to-Speech, Neural Topic Modelling and Efficient BERT model for QA on PDF's. I lead the Entreprise Deployment of Acrobat Android, making it more secure which lead to 10x growth in enterprise customers.
 Even before that, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in *Mathematics and Computing* from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in){:target="_blank"}.
